# Testing in Style - Reducing Barriers to Higher Code Quality Through Automation

In this interactive presentation we will look at tox in order to manage all our
testing needs in Python. We will start at zero knowledge and rapidly ramp up the
pace with in-depth looks at various Python testing tools. Particularly, we will
spend time on linting, pytest, and hypothesis. At the end we will round off the
talk with a brief introduction to continuous integration & deployment using
Travis CI.
